This is a synthetic model that expands the water only model to demonstrate coupled water and energy system simulation. The model includes different water demands (irrigation, water supply and, hydropower), and energy demands. Energy demands are supplied by hydropower plants and conventional thermal power plants. A simple transmission system connects the different energy supplies to the energy demands. We note that this energy system model does not include any dispatch constraints.
